- Raw data can be downloaded from ENA under the acession number Webin-63442. Raw BCR-sequencing data have to be preprocessed using the R and linux code in scrip/Preprocess/ folder before loading into the R markdown files for downstream analysis and visulization.  

- To facilitate the analysis, the processed BCR and single-cell RNAseq data can be downloaded in the data folder. 

- Package version information can be found in the LinkSeq paper method part.
