# Scripts for LinkSeq paper data analysis and visualization.

- Raw data can be downloaded from ENA under the acession number PRJEB57285. Raw BCR-sequencing data have to be preprocessed using the R and linux codes in scrip/Preprocess/ folder before loading into the R markdown files for downstream analysis and visulization.  

- For both bcr data preprocess and downstream analysis/visualization, functions in "BcrPreprocessFunction.R" and "linkseqFunctions.R" files have to be sourced correctly with the paths in your own computer. 

- To facilitate the analysis, the processed BCR and single-cell RNAseq data can be downloaded in the data folder. 

- Package version information can be found in the LinkSeq paper method part.
